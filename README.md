# NxN grid puzzle solver

An agent moves on a grid of NxN tiles and has to surpass obstacles in order to reach a final destination on the grid.

This solution uses a numer of search algorithms: depth-first search, breadth-first search, iterative deeping and a heuristic algorithm using hamming distance. These were used to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each method.
